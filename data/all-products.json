The thin and light structure, together with the elegantly designed leg, represent some reference elements for the whole collection with the difference that in this model, there is a multilayered cushion that recalls all the ages of the Matera's history. The visible stitches have been realised following a cross pattern, to remind the closure of the old bags of grain, and they all have been handcrafted in order to pay tribute once again to the feminine craftsmanship."

A 90° rotation of the panel allows the back cushions to be repositioned, thus increasing the seat depth for improved comfort.The Matheola, available with removable fabric covers or in leather, gets additional personality thanks to its versatility: when the panel is lowered, it lines up with the armrests thus enhancing the club sofa style.When the panel is lifted, the back becomes higher, thus reshaping the sofa's design.The lifted back can be used as a headrest and turns the sofa into a niche where to completely relax.A timeless model, with clean lines further enhanced by the hidden feet and feather padding, which ensures that the sofa will remain unaltered with time, thanks to the material's capacity to recover its original shape after being pressured."

    "description": "Like two proper wings, the backrests and the arms of the Toby Wing can spread to offer unique moments of pure relax. The back sections slid backwards increase the seat depth of 42 cm whereas the sideways moving arms once extended, increase the seat width of 25 cm. The Toby wing becomes a unique place, an island where to rest, dream, taking a break in full comfort."
